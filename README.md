# Phase 1 Project Lenore / Kelsey and Drew

## Summary
In this project for Flatiron School, Data Science Bootcamp, Lenore Kelsey and Drew explore IMDb data to determine the types of films that are doing well at the box office and then translate those findings into actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio venture. Our goal is to help executives decide what movies to make. 

We looked at the data provided to us for the project, determined the relationships and determined our investigation would focus on ratings and genres. We then cleaned the data, merged it into one useable csv file and analyzed the data. We then formulated our findings and reccomendations and put it together in the presentation slides.
