    "[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) is a public, online database with information about video media content and ratings of movies, which can be used to gage public sentiment towards different films. The IMDb datasets provide information about basic movie and crew information, as well as their ratings, which we used in this analysis. There are also unique IDs associated with both films and people to ensure there is no confusion with similarly named features. Most of these datasets were combined into one, named imdb, in order to facilitate the exploration of the data, though the basic descriptions of crew were kept seperate to help keep the data cleaner for the inital exploration."
